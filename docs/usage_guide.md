## Running star

```bash
star                        # launch Qt GUI (default when PyQt6/PyQt5 is installed)
star document.pdf          # open a PDF in the Qt GUI
star https://example.com   # fetch and read a URL
star notes.md              # open a Markdown file
star --tui report.docx     # force terminal UI mode
star --plain paper.pdf     # extract clean text to stdout (no UI)
star --rate 200 book.epub  # open with a slower reading speed
star --theme contrast      # start with the high-contrast theme
star --list-themes         # print available theme names and exit
star --list-voices         # list available TTS voices and exit
star --keytest             # open the key-code diagnostic tool (TUI)
```

The `star` command is provided by the wheel and the installer scripts. Running
from a source checkout instead? Use `python -m star …` (or `python run_star.py
…`) with the same arguments.

**Default mode:** The Qt GUI is star's primary interface — it opens
automatically when PyQt6/PyQt5 is installed. Without Qt, star falls back to the
secondary terminal TUI; use `--tui` to force the terminal interface even when Qt
is available.

## First run

The first time you launch the Qt GUI, star helps you get set up. None of these
steps is required — you can skip everything and start reading immediately.

### The guided tour

A short, skippable walkthrough of the controls that matter most — opening a
file, play/pause, changing speed, highlights & notes, the Voice Manager, the
library, and the reading aids — appears as a small floating card near each
control.

1. Read a step, then press **Right / Enter / N** for **Next** or **Left /
   Backspace / B** for **Back**.
2. Press **Esc** (or click **Skip tour**) to dismiss it. It will not pop up
   again on its own.
3. To take it again any time, choose **Help ▸ Guided Tour** (**Shift+F1**).

The tour is non-blocking (the window stays live behind it) and each step is
spoken to your screen reader as it appears.

### Pick your language

star's menus, toolbar, and messages are available in English, Spanish, French,
German, and Portuguese (the terminal UI is translatable too).

1. On first launch, the **Optional Features** window opens with an **Interface
   language** dropdown at the top — choose your language there. The whole
   interface switches immediately, with no restart.
2. To change it later, use **View ▸ Interface Language** in the Qt GUI.

### Add optional features (no `pip` needed)

star runs fully on its own; extra capabilities (OCR, an offline dictionary,
summarize, translate, and more) are optional downloads. On first launch a
chooser lets you pick what to fetch:

1. Pick a preset — **Thin** (lightweight everyday reading and study aids) or
   **All** (everything star can use) — or tick individual features. Each entry
   shows its purpose and approximate download size.
2. Click **Install selected** (or **Not now** to skip). star downloads the
   packages in the background while you keep reading.
3. Reopen the chooser any time from **Tools ▸ Install Optional Features…**.

You never have to run `pip` yourself. See
[Getting an optional feature on demand](#getting-an-optional-feature-on-demand)
below for what happens when you first use a feature you haven't installed yet.

### Check for updates

star does **not** phone home unless you ask it to. To see whether a newer
release is on PyPI, choose **Help ▸ Check for Updates…**. It reports the result
either way — a newer version (with a link), "up to date", or an offline
notice. (Power users: `star --check-update` does the same from the command
line.)

---

## Common tasks (how-to)

Task-oriented steps for the everyday workflows. Shortcuts below are the Qt GUI
defaults; every one is remappable from **Help ▸ Customize Shortcuts…**
(`Ctrl+Alt+Q`).

### Find text in the current document

An incremental find bar searches the open document as you type.

1. Press **Ctrl+F** (or **Edit ▸ Find…**). A search bar opens at the bottom of
   the window with focus in the input box.
2. Start typing. Matches highlight live; every match is tinted amber and the
   active one bright orange, and a **"N of M"** counter shows your position.
3. Press **Enter** (or **Next**) for the next match, **Shift+Enter** (or
   **Previous**) for the previous one. **F3 / Shift+F3** work too. Search
   **wraps around** the ends of the document.
4. Tick **Match case** for case-sensitive searching.
5. Press **Esc** (or the **×** button) to close the bar and clear the
   highlights.

The match count is also announced to screen readers, so you hear "3 of 12" or
"No matches" without leaving the search box.

### Set bookmarks and jump back and forth

Bookmarks are named positions saved per document; navigation history remembers
where you jumped from so you can retrace your steps. Both are shared with the
terminal UI, so a bookmark set in one interface shows up in the other.

**Add and use bookmarks**

1. Move to the spot you want to remember, then press **Ctrl+B** (or
   **Bookmarks ▸ Add Bookmark**). star saves it with an auto-name (`mark1`,
   `mark2`, …) and shows the position percentage in the status bar.
2. To name it yourself, use **Bookmarks ▸ Add Named Bookmark…** and type a name.
3. To return to one, open **Bookmarks ▸ Bookmarks…**, pick an entry (they are
   listed in document order), and press **Enter** or click **Go**. Use
   **Delete** to remove one.

**Back / forward history**

Every jump — a bookmark, a heading move, a search result — records where you
came from.

1. Press **Alt+←** (or **Navigate ▸ Back**) to step back to your previous
   reading position.
2. Press **Alt+→** (or **Navigate ▸ Forward**) to move forward again.

### Search your whole library by content

star can search *inside* every document in your library, not just their titles
and metadata.

1. Point star at a folder of documents as a library first
   (**File ▸ Open Folder as Library…**, or run `star <folder>`). See
   [Build a library](#build-a-library) below if you haven't set one up.
2. Open the library with **Ctrl+Shift+B** (**File ▸ Library / Bookshelf…**) and
   type in the filter box to narrow by title, path, or folder. Press **Enter**
   to open the highlighted document.
3. For a content search — finding documents by words that appear *inside* them —
   use **`M-x library-search`** in the terminal UI, which matches titles,
   authors, DOI/ISBN, annotations, and full document text. The full-text index
   is built on demand the first time you search and cached, so later searches
   are fast.

### Choose and download voices (Voice Manager)

The Voice Manager gathers every installed voice — across all your speech
engines — plus downloadable neural voices, in one searchable place.

1. Press **F4** (or **Speech ▸ Voice Manager…**).
2. Type in the **Filter** box to narrow the list by language or name, or tick
   **Favorites only** to see just your pinned voices.
3. Select a voice and click **Preview** to hear a short sample without
   committing to it.
4. Click **Set as Current** (or press **Enter** / double-click) to start using
   it for speech.
5. Click **Toggle Favorite** to pin a voice; favorites are marked with a ★ and
   persist across sessions.

**Download an offline Piper neural voice**

High-quality **Piper** neural voices (nine, covering all five interface
languages) appear in the list marked with a ⬇ download tag.

1. Select a ⬇ voice and click **Download**. star fetches the model in the
   background and reports progress.
2. When it finishes, star switches to the Piper engine and selects the new
   voice automatically — it works right away, fully offline from then on.

### Study what you read (spaced repetition)

Your highlights and notes can become a review deck that schedules each card for
you (using the FSRS spaced-repetition algorithm).

**Make cards**

1. Select a passage and apply a **Highlight** (toolbar button or
   **Ctrl+Shift+1…5**).
2. Add a note with **Ctrl+Shift+A** (**Notes ▸ Add Note at Cursor…**). The
   highlighted passage becomes the front of a card and your note the back.

**Review due cards**

1. Choose **Study ▸ Review Due Cards…** (**Ctrl+Shift+F5**).
2. Read the prompt on the front, then press **Enter** (or **Show Answer**) to
   reveal the note.
3. Grade your recall with **1** = Again, **2** = Hard, **3** = Good, **4** =
   Easy (or click the buttons). star reschedules the card immediately and moves
   to the next one — closing mid-session loses nothing.

The header shows how many cards are due and a running retention estimate.

**Export cards / sync with Anki**

- Export an Anki deck with **File ▸ Export ▸ Anki Flashcards…** (**Ctrl+Alt+H**).
  When prompted, answer **Yes** to also generate **cloze** (fill-in-the-blank)
  cards from your highlighted passages.
- To sync two-way with a running Anki, choose **Study ▸ Sync with Anki
  (AnkiConnect)…** (this needs the AnkiConnect add-on in Anki; if Anki isn't
  running you get a friendly hint instead of an error).

### Getting an optional feature on demand

When you use a feature whose add-on isn't installed yet, star offers to fetch it
for you — there is **never** a `pip install` instruction to copy.

1. Trigger the feature (for example **Tools ▸ Transcribe Audio File…**). If its
   add-on is missing, star asks *"Install `<feature>`?"* and shows the
   approximate download size.
2. Click **Install** (Yes). star downloads it in the background while you keep
   reading.
3. Most features become usable in the same session, and the status bar confirms
   *"… installed — you can use it now."* Only the large **speech-to-text**
   (dictation) pack asks you to **restart star** before using it.

Power users can install features from the command line instead:
`star --install-optional` (installs the `all` preset), `star --install-optional
thin`, or a comma-separated list of feature keys such as
`star --install-optional ocr,dictionary`. Run it with no value to list every
feature with its size and install status.

### Reading aids for comfortable reading

star includes several aids for low-vision, dyslexic, and fatigued readers. All
live under **View ▸ Reading Aids** unless noted.

- **High-contrast (AAA) theme.** Press **F5** to cycle themes until you reach
  **high-contrast**, or pick it directly with **View ▸ Choose Theme…**
  (**Ctrl+Alt+T**). It clears the AAA 7:1 contrast ratio for low-vision
  readers.
- **Follow your operating system.** By default star adopts your desktop's
  light / dark / high-contrast appearance on startup and keeps tracking it —
  until you deliberately pick a theme yourself, after which your choice sticks.
- **Dyslexia-friendly font.** Toggle **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ Dyslexia-Friendly
  Font** (**Ctrl+Alt+X**) to apply the **OpenDyslexic** typeface across the
  whole interface — document, menus, toolbar, and panels. If no such font is
  installed, star fetches OpenDyslexic automatically in the background (no `pip`,
  nothing to install by hand) and falls back gracefully offline.
- **RSVP one-word mode.** Turn on **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ RSVP Mode**
  (**Ctrl+Alt+E**) to show one word at a time in a large panel synced to
  speech — an aid many dyslexic readers find easier to track. Choose where the
  panel sits with **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ RSVP Position…**.
- **Clickable footnotes.** In documents with footnotes, click a footnote marker
  to jump to the note; a ↩ backlink jumps you back to where you were reading.
- **Math rendering.** Inline LaTeX math is rendered as readable Unicode, so
  equations are spoken and shown as text rather than raw `\command` markup.

<a id="build-a-library"></a>
### Build a library

Point star at *any* folder — including one synced by Dropbox, OneDrive,
Syncthing, or iCloud — and every document inside it becomes your library.

1. Use **File ▸ Open Folder as Library…**, or run `star <folder>`, and pick a
   folder.
2. Browse everything (alongside recently-opened files) via **File ▸ Library /
   Bookshelf…** (**Ctrl+Shift+B**).
3. Reading progress is saved per document and travels with the folder, so you
   can read on one machine and pick up where you left off on another.

## Quick command reference

Every primary feature mapped to its **Qt GUI menu path**, its **keyboard
shortcut**, and its **TUI command palette** (`M-x`) command. A `—` means the
action is not available in that interface. In the Qt GUI, tapping the `Ctrl` key
on its own also toggles play/pause (a JAWS habit; chords like `Ctrl+O` never
trigger it).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Both interfaces share the same navigation philosophy — single-letter or
`Ctrl+letter` shortcuts follow **NVDA / JAWS browse-mode conventions** so
screen-reader users have the same muscle memory in both modes.

> **Every Qt GUI menu item has a keyboard shortcut.** The shortcut is shown next
> to each command in its menu, and the full set is listed below (and in **Help →
> Keyboard Shortcuts**, `F3`). Each binding is owned by exactly one action, so
> there are no "ambiguous shortcut" conflicts. Any binding can be remapped from
> **Help → Customize Shortcuts…** (`Ctrl+Alt+Q`).
>
> **Modifier scheme:** `Ctrl+letter` = forward / primary action,
> `Ctrl+Shift+letter` = backward / secondary, `Alt+punctuation` = sentence
> navigation, and `Ctrl+Alt+letter` = exports, citations, tools, and reading aids.

### Play / pause with the Ctrl key (JAWS habit)

Tapping (pressing and releasing) the **`Ctrl`** key on its own toggles speech,
mirroring the JAWS muscle memory of hitting Ctrl to silence speech. Using Ctrl as
a modifier in a chord (`Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+H`, …) never triggers it — only a clean
solo tap does. It is active while the document view has focus and can be turned
off with the `qt_ctrl_pause` setting.

### Playback (both modes)

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|
| Play / pause | `Space`  ·  tap `Ctrl` | `Space` |
| Stop | `Esc` | `Esc` |
| Speed up (+20 wpm) | `Ctrl+=` | `+` |
| Slow down (−20 wpm) | `Ctrl+-` | `-` |
| Play from cursor / selection | `Ctrl+Return` | — |
| Choose TTS engine | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | `M-x tts-backend` |
| Choose voice | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | `Ctrl+T` |
| Pronunciation lexicon | `Ctrl+Shift+I` | `M-x pron-add` / `pron-list` |
| Speech Cursor mode | `Tab` | `Tab` |
| Toggle SSML prosody | `Ctrl+Alt+Y` | `M-x ssml` |
| Cycle speed preset | `F8` | `F8` |

The default reading rate is **265 wpm**. New users should start at 150–180 wpm
and increase gradually.

### Profiles (saved setting bundles)

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|
| Save current settings as a profile | `Ctrl+Shift+K` | `M-x profile-save <name>` |
| Load a profile | `Ctrl+Shift+J` | `M-x profile-load <name>` |
| Delete a profile | `Ctrl+Shift+Y` | `M-x profile-delete <name>` |
| List profiles | Profiles menu | `M-x profile-list` |

### Structure navigation (both modes)

Keys are shared between the Qt GUI and the TUI. The TUI also accepts the legacy
bracket keys as fallbacks.

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|
| Next heading (reads aloud) | `Ctrl+H` | `h`   `>`   `}` (legacy) |
| Previous heading (reads aloud) | `Ctrl+Shift+H` | `<`   `{` (legacy) |
| Next paragraph | `Ctrl+P` | `p`   `Ctrl+P`   `]` (legacy) |
| Previous paragraph | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `P`   `[` (legacy) |
| Replay paragraph | `Ctrl+R` | `r`   `Ctrl+R` |
| Next table | `Ctrl+T` | `t` |
| Previous table | `Ctrl+Shift+T` | `T` |
| Next sentence | `Alt+.` | `.` |
| Previous sentence | `Alt+,` | `,` |
| Replay sentence | `Alt+;` | `;` |
| Play from cursor / selection | `Ctrl+Return` | — |

### Scroll navigation (TUI)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `k` | Scroll one line up |
| `↓` / `j` | Scroll one line down |
| `PgUp` / `b` | Page up |
| `PgDn` | Page down |
| `Home` | Jump to beginning of document |
| `End` | Jump to end of document |
| `H` | History: go back to previous position |
| `L` | History: go forward |

### File & export

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|
| Open a file | `Ctrl+O` | `Ctrl+O` |
| Open a URL | `Ctrl+Shift+O` | `M-x open-url` |
| Open an archive | File ▸ Open Archive… | `M-x open-archive` |
| Edit document metadata | File ▸ Edit Document Metadata… | `M-x metadata-edit` |
| Library / Bookshelf | `Ctrl+Shift+B` | `M-x library` |
| Library search | — | `M-x library-search` |
| Export as Markdown | `Ctrl+Alt+M` | `M-x export-markdown` |
| Export as PDF | `Ctrl+Alt+P` | — |
| Export as Braille (BRF) | `Ctrl+Alt+B` | `M-x export-braille` |
| Export as Audio | `Ctrl+Alt+A` | `M-x export-audio` |
| Export Subtitles (SRT/VTT) | `Ctrl+Alt+U` | `M-x export-subtitles` |
| Export karaoke video (MP4) | `Ctrl+Alt+V` | `M-x export-video` |
| Reload document | — | `F9` |
| Quit | `Ctrl+Q` | `Ctrl+Q`   `q` |

### Editing (Qt GUI only)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+E` | Toggle edit mode (raw Markdown ↔ rendered view) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save in edit mode; export as Markdown in read mode |
| `Ctrl+Shift+L` | Toggle the live HTML preview pane (enters edit mode if needed) |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` | Cut / copy / paste |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy selection or current paragraph (read mode) |

### Search

In the Qt GUI, `Ctrl+F` opens an incremental **find bar** at the bottom of the
window with a live match counter, next/previous, a case toggle, and wrap-around
(see [Find text in the current document](#find-text-in-the-current-document)).

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|
| Open find bar / search forward | `Ctrl+F` | `Ctrl+F`   `/` |
| Next match | `Enter`   `F3` | `n` |

| Close find / clear search | `Esc` | `Esc`   `C-g` |

In the Qt find bar, every match is tinted amber and the active match bright
orange, with a "N of M" counter. In the TUI, the current match shows in magenta
and the others in blue.

### Bookmarks & navigation history

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|

| History: back | `Alt+←` | `H` |
| History: forward | `Alt+→` | `L` |

Bookmarks are stored per document and shared between the Qt GUI and the TUI, so
a bookmark set in one interface appears in the other.

In the TUI the terminal cursor is always parked at the **minibuffer** so screen
readers receive echoed text in one predictable location; the document scrolls
visually without moving the cursor.

## Plain-text mode

```bash
star --plain document.pdf
```

`--plain` skips all UI and writes clean, stripped plain text to stdout — the same
text the TTS engine would receive. Useful for:

- **Piping** — `star --plain paper.pdf | festival --tts`
- **Batch processing** — extract text from many files in a shell script
- **Word counting** — `star --plain thesis.pdf | wc -w`
- **Headless server use** — where no display is available
