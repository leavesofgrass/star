## Running star

```bash
star                        # launch Qt GUI (default when PyQt6/PyQt5 is installed)
star document.pdf          # open a PDF in the Qt GUI
star https://example.com   # fetch and read a URL
star notes.md              # open a Markdown file
star --tui report.docx     # force terminal UI mode
star --plain paper.pdf     # extract clean text to stdout (no UI)
star --rate 200 book.epub  # open with a slower reading speed
star --theme contrast      # start with the high-contrast theme
star --list-themes         # print available theme names and exit
star --list-voices         # list available TTS voices and exit
star --keytest             # open the key-code diagnostic tool (TUI)
```

The `star` command is provided by the wheel and the installer scripts. Running
from a source checkout instead? Use `python -m star …` (or `python run_star.py
…`) with the same arguments.

**Default mode:** The Qt GUI is star's primary interface — it opens
automatically when PyQt6/PyQt5 is installed. Without Qt, star falls back to the
secondary terminal TUI; use `--tui` to force the terminal interface even when Qt
is available.

---

## First run

The first time you launch the Qt GUI, star helps you get set up. None of these
steps is required — you can skip everything and start reading immediately.

### The guided tour

A short, skippable walkthrough of the controls that matter most — opening a
file, play/pause, changing speed, highlights & notes, the Voice Manager, the
library, and the reading aids — appears as a small floating card near each
control.

1. Read a step, then press **Right / Enter / N** for **Next** or **Left /
   Backspace / B** for **Back**.
2. Press **Esc** (or click **Skip tour**) to dismiss it. It will not pop up
   again on its own.
3. To take it again any time, choose **Help ▸ Guided Tour** (**Shift+F1**).

The tour is non-blocking (the window stays live behind it) and each step is
spoken to your screen reader as it appears.

### Pick your language

star's menus, toolbar, and messages are available in English, Spanish, French,
German, and Portuguese (the terminal UI is translatable too). Arabic is also
included as a first right-to-left catalog.

1. On first launch, the **Optional Features** window opens with an **Interface
   language** dropdown at the top — choose your language there. The whole
   interface switches immediately, with no restart.
2. To change it later, use **View ▸ Interface Language** in the Qt GUI.

**Right-to-left languages.** Selecting a right-to-left interface language (such
as Arabic) mirrors the whole app — menus, toolbar, and panels flip to the right
— and the reading view renders right-to-left as well. Switching back to a
left-to-right language restores the normal layout live, with no restart.

### Add optional features (no `pip` needed)

star runs fully on its own; extra capabilities (OCR, an offline dictionary,
summarize, translate, and more) are optional downloads. On first launch a
chooser lets you pick what to fetch:

1. Pick a preset — **Thin** (lightweight everyday reading and study aids) or
   **All** (everything star can use) — or tick individual features. Each entry
   shows its purpose and approximate download size.
2. Click **Install selected** (or **Not now** to skip). star downloads the
   packages in the background while you keep reading.
3. Reopen the chooser any time from **Tools ▸ Install Optional Features…**.

You never have to run `pip` yourself. See
[Getting an optional feature on demand](#getting-an-optional-feature-on-demand)
below for what happens when you first use a feature you haven't installed yet.

### Check for updates

star does **not** phone home unless you ask it to. To see whether a newer
release is on PyPI, choose **Help ▸ Check for Updates…**. It reports the result
either way — a newer version (with a link), "up to date", or an offline
notice. (Power users: `star --check-update` does the same from the command
line.)

---

## Common tasks (how-to)

Task-oriented steps for the everyday workflows. Shortcuts below are the Qt GUI
defaults; every one is remappable from **Help ▸ Customize Shortcuts…**
(`Ctrl+Alt+Q`).

### Find text in the current document

An incremental find bar searches the open document as you type.

1. Press **Ctrl+F** (or **Edit ▸ Find…**). A search bar opens at the bottom of
   the window with focus in the input box.
2. Start typing. Matches highlight live; every match is tinted amber and the
   active one bright orange, and a **"N of M"** counter shows your position.
3. Press **Enter** (or **Next**) for the next match, **Shift+Enter** (or
   **Previous**) for the previous one. **F3 / Shift+F3** work too. Search
   **wraps around** the ends of the document.
4. Tick **Match case** for case-sensitive searching.
5. Press **Esc** (or the **×** button) to close the bar and clear the
   highlights.

The match count is also announced to screen readers, so you hear "3 of 12" or
"No matches" without leaving the search box.

### Set bookmarks and jump back and forth

Bookmarks are named positions saved per document; navigation history remembers
where you jumped from so you can retrace your steps. Both are shared with the
terminal UI, so a bookmark set in one interface shows up in the other.

**Add and use bookmarks**

1. Move to the spot you want to remember, then press **Ctrl+B** (or
   **Bookmarks ▸ Add Bookmark**). star saves it with an auto-name (`mark1`,
   `mark2`, …) and shows the position percentage in the status bar.
2. To name it yourself, use **Bookmarks ▸ Add Named Bookmark…** and type a name.
3. To return to one, open **Bookmarks ▸ Bookmarks…**, pick an entry (they are
   listed in document order), and press **Enter** or click **Go**. Use
   **Delete** to remove one.

**Back / forward history**

Every jump — a bookmark, a heading move, a search result — records where you
came from.

1. Press **Alt+←** (or **Navigate ▸ Back**) to step back to your previous
   reading position.
2. Press **Alt+→** (or **Navigate ▸ Forward**) to move forward again.

### Search your whole library by content

star can search *inside* every document in your library, not just their titles
and metadata.

1. Point star at a folder of documents as a library first
   (**File ▸ Open Folder as Library…**, or run `star <folder>`). See
   [Build a library](#build-a-library) below if you haven't set one up.
2. Open the library with **Ctrl+Shift+B** (**File ▸ Library / Bookshelf…**) and
   type in the filter box to narrow by title, path, or folder. Press **Enter**
   to open the highlighted document.
3. For a content search — finding documents by words that appear *inside* them —
   use **`M-x library-search`** in the terminal UI, which matches titles,
   authors, DOI/ISBN, annotations, and full document text. The full-text index
   is built on demand the first time you search and cached, so later searches
   are fast.

### Choose and download voices (Voice Manager)

The Voice Manager gathers every installed voice — across all your speech
engines — plus downloadable neural voices, in one searchable place.

1. Press **F4** (or **Speech ▸ Voice Manager…**).
2. Type in the **Filter** box to narrow the list by language or name, or tick
   **Favorites only** to see just your pinned voices.
3. Select a voice and click **Preview** to hear a short sample without
   committing to it.
4. Click **Set as Current** (or press **Enter** / double-click) to start using
   it for speech.
5. Click **Toggle Favorite** to pin a voice; favorites are marked with a ★ and
   persist across sessions.

**Download an offline Piper neural voice**

High-quality **Piper** neural voices (nine, covering all five interface
languages) appear in the list marked with a ⬇ download tag.

1. Select a ⬇ voice and click **Download**. star fetches the model in the
   background and reports progress.
2. When it finishes, star switches to the Piper engine and selects the new
   voice automatically — it works right away, fully offline from then on.

### Pick a speech engine (system and cloud voices)

Beyond the built-in engines, star can also speak with your operating system's
own voices or with a cloud service. Change engines from **Speech ▸ Choose TTS
Engine…** (**Ctrl+Shift+G**), or `M-x tts-backend` in the terminal UI. The
Voice Manager (**F4**) then lists that engine's voices for filtering and
preview.

- **`elevenlabs` — cloud neural voices (opt-in).** Premium neural speech from
  the ElevenLabs service. **Nothing is sent anywhere** until you both paste your
  key and select a cloud voice: put your key in the **`elevenlabs_api_key`**
  setting (edit `settings.json` via **`M-x settings`**, or set the
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable), then select the `elevenlabs`
  engine and choose a voice. With no key the engine stays unavailable and star
  keeps using a local engine; on any network error it silently falls back to a
  local voice too. Cloud voices are never auto-selected.

### Study what you read (spaced repetition)

Your highlights and notes can become a review deck that schedules each card for
you (using the FSRS spaced-repetition algorithm).

**Make cards**

1. Select a passage and apply a **Highlight** (toolbar button or
   **Ctrl+Shift+1…5**).
2. Add a note with **Ctrl+Shift+A** (**Notes ▸ Add Note at Cursor…**). The
   highlighted passage becomes the front of a card and your note the back.

**Review due cards**

1. Choose **Study ▸ Review Due Cards…** (**Ctrl+Shift+F5**).
2. Read the prompt on the front, then press **Enter** (or **Show Answer**) to
   reveal the note.
3. Grade your recall with **1** = Again, **2** = Hard, **3** = Good, **4** =
   Easy (or click the buttons). star reschedules the card immediately and moves
   to the next one — closing mid-session loses nothing.

The header shows how many cards are due and a running retention estimate.

**Export cards / sync with Anki**

- Export an Anki deck with **File ▸ Export ▸ Anki Flashcards…** (**Ctrl+Alt+H**).
  When prompted, answer **Yes** to also generate **cloze** (fill-in-the-blank)
  cards from your highlighted passages.
- To sync two-way with a running Anki, choose **Study ▸ Sync with Anki
  (AnkiConnect)…** (this needs the AnkiConnect add-on in Anki; if Anki isn't
  running you get a friendly hint instead of an error).

### Getting an optional feature on demand

When you use a feature whose add-on isn't installed yet, star offers to fetch it
for you — there is **never** a `pip install` instruction to copy.

1. Trigger the feature (for example **Tools ▸ Transcribe Audio File…**). If its
   add-on is missing, star asks *"Install `<feature>`?"* and shows the
   approximate download size.
2. Click **Install** (Yes). star downloads it in the background while you keep
   reading.
3. Most features become usable in the same session, and the status bar confirms
   *"… installed — you can use it now."* Only the large **speech-to-text**
   (dictation) pack asks you to **restart star** before using it.

Power users can install features from the command line instead:
`star --install-optional` (installs the `all` preset), `star --install-optional
thin`, or a comma-separated list of feature keys such as
`star --install-optional ocr,dictionary`. Run it with no value to list every
feature with its size and install status.

### Reading aids for comfortable reading

star includes several aids for low-vision, dyslexic, and fatigued readers. All
live under **View ▸ Reading Aids** unless noted.

- **High-contrast (AAA) theme.** Press **F5** to cycle themes until you reach
  **high-contrast**, or pick it directly with **View ▸ Choose Theme…**
  (**Ctrl+Alt+T**). It clears the AAA 7:1 contrast ratio for low-vision
  readers.
- **Follow your operating system.** By default star adopts your desktop's
  light / dark / high-contrast appearance on startup and keeps tracking it —
  until you deliberately pick a theme yourself, after which your choice sticks.
- **Dyslexia-friendly font.** Toggle **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ Dyslexia-Friendly
  Font** (**Ctrl+Alt+X**) to apply the **OpenDyslexic** typeface across the
  whole interface — document, menus, toolbar, and panels. If no such font is
  installed, star fetches OpenDyslexic automatically in the background (no `pip`,
  nothing to install by hand) and falls back gracefully offline.
- **Reading font chooser.** For more choices than the dyslexia toggle, open
  **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ Reading Font** and pick **Default**, **OpenDyslexic**,
  **Atkinson Hyperlegible** (a Braille Institute face designed for low vision),
  or **Lexend**. The chosen font applies everywhere; each is fetched on first use
  in the background (no `pip`). Menu-only — no shortcut. (The `Ctrl+Alt+X`
  toggle above is a quick shortcut for OpenDyslexic on/off.)
- **Syllable splitting.** Toggle **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ Syllable Splitting** to
  show words broken into syllables (`read·a·bil·i·ty`) — a decoding aid. It is
  display-only, so speech and highlighting are unaffected. Menu-only — no
  shortcut. (Installs itself on first use, then works immediately with no
  restart.)
- **Reading ruler.** Toggle **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ Reading Ruler** to show a
  movable, translucent band (a typoscope) that follows the caret line to help
  you keep your place. To adjust its height, opacity, and band color, open
  **Edit ▸ Preferences… (Ctrl+,)** — or **Tune Reading Ruler…** in the
  **Command Palette (F2)** for live tuning; the color picker there includes a
  **Use highlight color** button to match the reading highlight. The toggle is
  menu-only — no shortcut.
- **Highlight colors.** Open **Edit ▸ Preferences… (Ctrl+,)** — or **Tune
  Karaoke Highlight…** in the **Command Palette (F2)** — to pick the
  spoken-**Word color** and, for **Both**
  granularity, the **Sentence color** band — the band can **follow the theme**
  (a **Use theme** button) or use a color you choose, so the word and the band
  stand apart.
- **Follow-scroll.** While speech plays, the reading view auto-scrolls to keep
  the spoken word in a steady middle reading band instead of drifting to the
  bottom edge. It is on by default; turn it off with the `qt_autoscroll` setting.
- **RSVP one-word mode.** Turn on **View ▸ Reading Aids ▸ RSVP Mode**
  (**Ctrl+Alt+E**) to show one word at a time in a large panel synced to
  speech — an aid many dyslexic readers find easier to track. Choose where the
  panel sits in **Edit ▸ Preferences… (Ctrl+,)**, or with **Tune RSVP
  Position…** in the **Command Palette (F2)**.
- **Clickable footnotes.** In documents with footnotes, click a footnote marker
  to jump to the note; a ↩ backlink jumps you back to where you were reading.
- **Math rendering.** Inline LaTeX math is rendered as readable Unicode, so
  equations are spoken and shown as text rather than raw `\command` markup.

<a id="build-a-library"></a>
### Build a library

Point star at *any* folder — including one synced by Dropbox, OneDrive,
Syncthing, or iCloud — and every document inside it becomes your library.

1. Use **File ▸ Open Folder as Library…**, or run `star <folder>`, and pick a
   folder.
2. Browse everything (alongside recently-opened files) via **File ▸ Library /
   Bookshelf…** (**Ctrl+Shift+B**).
3. Reading progress is saved per document and travels with the folder, so you
   can read on one machine and pick up where you left off on another.

### Read very large documents smoothly

For very large documents, star can render only a window of the document at a
time (pagination) so the first page appears almost instantly instead of after a
multi-second layout.

1. Pagination is **opt-in**. Turn it on by setting **`qt_paginate_large_docs`**
   to `true` in `settings.json` (open it with **`M-x settings`**, or **Tools**
   in the TUI).
2. Once enabled, it engages **automatically** only when a document is very large
   (past roughly 60,000 words) — smaller documents render whole as before.
3. It is **transparent to reading**: playback, highlighting, and Define Word
   stay correct across page boundaries, and the status bar notes when a document
   is paginated.

Two things always render the **whole** document (so nothing is missed):

- **Find** (`Ctrl+F`) searches the entire document, not just the visible window.
- **Highlighting** a document — or turning on **Highlight Difficult Words** —
  renders it in full so highlight placement stays exact. Highlighting a very
  large document turns pagination off for that session (with a status note).

## Quick command reference

Every primary feature mapped to its **Qt GUI menu path**, its **keyboard
shortcut**, and its **TUI command palette** (`M-x`) command. A `—` means the
action is not available in that interface. In the Qt GUI, tapping the `Ctrl` key
on its own also toggles play/pause (a JAWS habit; chords like `Ctrl+O` never
trigger it).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Both interfaces share the same navigation philosophy — single-letter or
`Ctrl+letter` shortcuts follow **NVDA / JAWS browse-mode conventions** so
screen-reader users have the same muscle memory in both modes.

> **Every Qt GUI menu item has a keyboard shortcut.** The shortcut is shown next
> to each command in its menu, and the full set is listed below (and in **Help →
> Keyboard Shortcuts**, `F3`). Each binding is owned by exactly one action, so
> there are no "ambiguous shortcut" conflicts. Any binding can be remapped from
> **Help → Customize Shortcuts…** (`Ctrl+Alt+Q`).
>
> **Modifier scheme:** `Ctrl+letter` = forward / primary action,
> `Ctrl+Shift+letter` = backward / secondary, `Alt+punctuation` = sentence
> navigation, and `Ctrl+Alt+letter` = exports, citations, tools, and reading aids.

### Play / pause with the Ctrl key (JAWS habit)

Tapping (pressing and releasing) the **`Ctrl`** key on its own toggles speech,
mirroring the JAWS muscle memory of hitting Ctrl to silence speech. Using Ctrl as
a modifier in a chord (`Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+H`, …) never triggers it — only a clean
solo tap does. It is active while the document view has focus and can be turned
off with the `qt_ctrl_pause` setting.

### Playback (both modes)

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |
|---|---|---|

In the Qt GUI, `Ctrl+F` opens an incremental **find bar** at the bottom of the
window with a live match counter, next/previous, a case toggle, and wrap-around
(see [Find text in the current document](#find-text-in-the-current-document)).

| Action | Qt GUI | TUI |

| Search backward | — | `Ctrl+R`   `?` |
| Close find / clear search | `Esc` | `Esc`   `C-g` |

In the Qt find bar, every match is tinted amber and the active match bright
orange, with a "N of M" counter. In the TUI, the current match shows in magenta
and the others in blue.

Bookmarks are stored per document and shared between the Qt GUI and the TUI, so
a bookmark set in one interface appears in the other.

In the TUI the terminal cursor is always parked at the **minibuffer** so screen
readers receive echoed text in one predictable location; the document scrolls
visually without moving the cursor.

### Qt menus

**File menu** — Open…, Open URL…, Open Archive…, Open Feed…, Edit Document
Metadata…, Library / Bookshelf…, Batch Convert, Watch Folder, Export ▸
(Markdown / PDF / Braille (BRF) / Audio / Subtitles / Video (MP4) / **Export
Audiobook (M4B)…** / Anki Flashcards), Quit. **Export Audiobook (M4B)…** writes
a chaptered `.m4b` (chapters come from the document's headings) for listening on
the go; it is menu-only and needs `ffmpeg` on your PATH.

**Edit menu** — Find… (`Ctrl+F`, the incremental find bar), Copy, Toggle Edit
Mode, Save, Check Spelling, and **Preferences…** (`Ctrl+,`) — all reader
settings in one tabbed dialog (Reading / Voice / Display / General).

**Highlight menu** — Highlight Yellow / Green / Cyan / Pink / Orange, Clear All
Highlights. (`Ctrl+H` is the **Next Heading** shortcut, matching NVDA/JAWS
convention; use the toolbar Highlight button or this menu to apply colors.)

**Navigate menu** — sentence / paragraph / heading / table moves, plus **Back**
(`Alt+←`) and **Forward** (`Alt+→`) through your navigation history.

**Bookmarks menu** — Add Bookmark (`Ctrl+B`), Add Named Bookmark…, and
Bookmarks… (the jump/delete list).

**Study menu** — Review Due Cards… (`Ctrl+Shift+F5`, spaced-repetition review of
your notes and highlights) and Sync with Anki (AnkiConnect)….

**View menu** — Toggle Contents Panel (`Ctrl+\`), Toggle Notes Panel
(`Ctrl+Shift+N`), Next Theme (`F5`), Choose Theme…, Reload CSS Themes, Open
Themes Folder, Change Font…, Reading Level (`Ctrl+L`), and **Reading Aids ▸**
Text Spacing… /
Reading Font (Default / OpenDyslexic / Atkinson Hyperlegible / Lexend) /
Dyslexia-Friendly Font / Bionic Reading / Syllable Splitting / Current-Line
Highlight / Reading Ruler /
Highlight Difficult Words / Define Word… / RSVP Mode / Live HTML Preview.
(Karaoke-highlight, reading-ruler, and RSVP-position settings live in
**Edit ▸ Preferences…** (`Ctrl+,`); the live-tuning dialogs are in the
**Command Palette (F2)** as Tune Karaoke Highlight… / Tune Reading Ruler… /
Tune RSVP Position….)

**Speech menu** — Play/Pause, Stop, speed, Choose TTS Engine… (`Ctrl+Shift+G`;
engines include the opt-in `elevenlabs` cloud engine — see [Pick a speech engine](#pick-a-speech-engine-system-and-cloud-voices)),
Choose Voice…, **Voice Manager…** (`F4`, filter / preview / favorite / download
voices), Speech Cursor Mode, and the Pronunciation Lexicon.

**Tools menu** — leads with **Install Optional Features…** (the download
chooser), then Transcribe Audio File…, Dictate Note…, Summarize / Translate,
Reading Statistics…, and Clear Document Cache.

**Help menu** — Command Palette…, Keyboard Shortcuts…, Customize Shortcuts…,
**Guided Tour** (`Shift+F1`), Help (`F1`), Open Documentation, **Check for
Updates…**, and **About star** (`Ctrl+F1`) — a short summary of what star is and
does, the version and license, and a clickable link to the project on GitHub
(opens in your browser).

**Profiles, Notes, Citations menus** — see the
[Quick command reference](#quick-command-reference) for every item, its menu
path, and its shortcut.

### Toolbar

The toolbar is divided into labeled groups separated by dividers: **File** (Open
· URL), **Playback** (Play/Pause · Stop · − Speed · + Speed), **Navigate**
(sentence / paragraph / heading moves), **Voice / Mode** (Voice… · SC), **Text**
(Copy · Highlight · Clear Highlights), **View** (Theme · ToC · Level · Font),
**Edit** (Edit · Save), and **App** (Help · Quit). Every button shows a tooltip
describing its action and keyboard shortcut.

The left-side **Table of Contents** dock lists all headings in the current
document; click any entry to jump there. Toggle it with `Ctrl+\`.

---

## Plain-text mode

```bash
star --plain document.pdf
```

`--plain` skips all UI and writes clean, stripped plain text to stdout — the same
text the TTS engine would receive. Useful for:

- **Piping** — `star --plain paper.pdf | festival --tts`
- **Batch processing** — extract text from many files in a shell script
- **Word counting** — `star --plain thesis.pdf | wc -w`
- **Headless server use** — where no display is available
